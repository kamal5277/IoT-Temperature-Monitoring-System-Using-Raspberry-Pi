# IoT-Temperature-Monitoring-System-Using-Raspberry-Pi
This project is an IoT-based temperature monitoring system that uses a Raspberry Pi and a DHT sensor (DHT11/DHT22) to monitor and control the temperature in a hotel room. The system ensures that room temperatures remain within an optimal range, enhancing customer comfort.

# Features
- Publisher Program: Reads data from the DHT sensor and publishes it to an MQTT broker every 60 seconds.
- Subscriber Program: Subscribes to the temperature data from the MQTT broker, checks if the temperature exceeds a threshold for 5 consecutive minutes, and logs the data locally.
- Server Program: Exposes the latest temperature data via an HTTP API.

# Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO pins)
- DHT11 or DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Jumper wires
- Internet connection for the Raspberry Pi

# Software Requirements

- Raspberry Pi OS (or any Linux-based OS for Raspberry Pi)
- Python 3
- MQTT Broker (e.g., Mosquitto)
- Python Libraries (see `requirements.txt`)
# Installation

1.Clone the Repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://https://github.com/kamal5277/IoT-Temperature-Monitoring-System-Using-Raspberry-Pi
   cd IoT-Temperature-Monitoring-System-Using-Raspberry-Pi

2.Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Connect the DHT Sensor:
VCC: Connect to the 3.3V pin on the Raspberry Pi.
GND: Connect to a Ground pin on the Raspberry Pi.
Data: Connect to GPIO4 (or another GPIO pin, but update the code accordingly).

Usage
Publisher Program
The Publisher Program reads temperature data from the DHT sensor and publishes it to an MQTT topic every 60 seconds.

To run the Publisher Program:
python publisher.py

Subscriber Program
The Subscriber Program listens to the MQTT topic, checks if the temperature exceeds a threshold for 5 consecutive minutes, and logs the data locally.

To run the Subscriber Program:
python subscriber.py

Server Program
The Server Program exposes the last logged temperature data via an HTTP endpoint.

To run the Server Program:
python server.py
You can access the temperature data by navigating to http://<Raspberry_Pi_IP>:5000/sensor-data in your browser.

MQTT Broker
This project uses a public MQTT broker (test.mosquitto.org). You can set up your own MQTT broker using Mosquitto if you prefer.
